# Video Editor Architecture

## Overview
The video editor follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer
- MVVM Pattern for UI components
- Jetpack Compose for modern UI
- ViewModel for state management

### 2. Domain Layer
- Video processing use cases
- Audio processing use cases
- Effect management
- Timeline management

### 3. Data Layer
- Video file handling
- Cache management
- Project storage
- Asset management

## Core Components

### Video Processing Engine
- FFmpeg integration for video processing
- Custom GPU shaders for real-time effects
- Hardware acceleration support

### Timeline Engine
- Multi-track support
- Real-time preview
- Frame-accurate editing

### AI/ML Engine
- TensorFlow Lite integration
- ML Kit for face detection
- Custom models for video enhancement

## Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous video processing
- Memory efficient frame handling
- GPU acceleration for effects
- Background processing for exports
